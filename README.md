# Inklings Timeline
*An interactive timeline of events in the life of the Inklings and its members.*

## What This Is
This site is a browser-based interactive timeline of the Inklings and
its members, focusing especially on C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien, and
constructed using vis-timeline.

I was looking around to try and find a resource that would help me be able
to visualize the relationship between various events in the Inklings lives.
(*Did Lewis publish any books during his Great War with Owen Barfield?
What was Tolkien working on writing when Charles Williams moved to Oxford?* etc.)
The resources I could find either didn't cover enough material (focused
just on one Inkling, or didn't go into much detail) or they were text-heavy
and difficult to visualize. So I decided to make my own.

This is still very early-stage and experimental. I'm fairly new to programming,
and anticipate this project growing with me as my skills develop!

## Try It Out
All you have to do to try it out is visit[mdwicker.github.io/inklings-timeline]
(https://mdwicker.github.io/inklings-timeline).

## Current Features
- Hierarchical groups (e.g. Tolkien -> Life Events, Location, etc)
- Top-level groups can be collapsed with the arrow
- Click on a subgroup name to show/hide its events


## Limitations (for now)
- Scrolling and zooming is still a bit glitchy and unintuitive, at least on some devices.
- Data structuring isn't perfect--it's a work in progress
- No filtering panel
- Quite data heavy and hard to parse when zoomed way out

## Roadmap
- Add icon to indicate group visibility
- Clean up data structuring
- Cleaner UI (more color-coding, etc)
- Add more data! Other Inklings, general life events, creative process
- Restructure to use modules once my skill level grows

## Notes
This is still quite messy because I'm still learning! I've decided to jump
in and get my hands dirty without waiting to be an expert, so that I can
learn by doing! I'm definitely hoping to keep tweaking this as my skills grow,
so that it can grow with me.
